<P>
This course is an introduction to the concepts and principles of computer networks. Students will design and implement projects using application protocols, and will study transport, network, and data link protocols and algorithms. The course also includes an introduction to local area networks, data transmission fundamentals, and network security. Programming projects and reading research papers will be required.

<H3>
Term Project
</H3>
<p>
You are to work as a team of two students for the term project.
All of the team members should fairly contribute to the project and 
presentations. Your contribution will affect your grade.
Your project will be presented in week 15. NO LATE PROJECT
WILL BE ACCEPTED, NO DEADLINE EXTENSION WILL BE GIVEN, and NO PRESENTATION
RESCHEDULING WILL BE GRANTED unless extenuating
circumstances arise. See the <a href="./proj/proj4/proj.html">project page</a> for more details.

<H3>
Programming Project
</H3>
<p>
There will be one programming project. The basic
knowledge of Java/C/C++ and UNIX is required. 
The project is to be submitted
electronically by 11:59:59pm on the specified due date. NO LATE PROJECTS
WILL BE ACCEPTED and NO DEADLINE EXTENSION WILL BE GIVEN unless extenuating
circumstances arise.

<H3>
Quizzes and Final
</H3>
<p>
There will be three quizzes and a two-hour final
exam. NO MAKE-UP EXAM or Quizzes will be given unless
you have a "life threatening emergency." In such a case, you must discuss
with the instructor BEFORE the exam takes place.
The fnal will take place on:
<UL>
<LI>Final: <B>Mon., Dec. 16, 2013, 12:30-2:30pm, GOL-1435</B>
</UL>

<H3>
Homework
</H3>
There will be 3-4 homework assignments. The homeworks are due at the
beginning of the lecture.
NO LATE HOMEWORK will be accepted.
NO DEADLINE EXTENSION will be given unless extenuating circumstances arise.

<H3>
General Policies
</H3>
<b>Any missed exams, projects, or homework assignments will get zero</b>.<br><br>
Class attendance is very important. I will keep a record of attendance.
This attendance will be considered when a grading difficulty arises.
If you miss a class, it is your responsibility to acquire any missed
materials.<br><br>
Note that questions about grading must be brought to my attention within
one week after the graded material has been handed back. After that time,
the grade will become permanent.<br><br>
No extra work will be given to help students to raise grades due to fairness
concerns.<br><br>
I expect students to respect their instructor, teaching assistants, and
other students in class. <b>Disrespectful behavior will NOT be tolerated.</b>
Do NOT come to class late, leave early, or talk to other students, etc.
However, class participation and discussion are strongly encouraged.<br><br>

Academic Honesty
</H3>
<P>
Any form of academic dishonesty is strictly prohibited. I will handle any such
incident according to the Department of Computer Science
<A href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/programs/academicintegrity">Policy on Academic
Dishonesty</A>. Violations of the 
<a href="http://www.cs.rit.edu/resources/computing/codeofconduct">
Code of Conduct for the Use of Department of Computer Science Facilities</a>
can also result in suspension, expulsion and even criminal charges.
Please refer to the following statements excerpted from the
1998-99 RIT Students Rights & Responsibilities handbook:

<blockquote>
<p>
Any act of improperly representing another person's work as one's own is construed
as an act of academic dishonesty. These acts include, but are not limited to, 
plagiarism in any form, or use of information and materials not authorized by 
the instructor during an examination. 

<p>
If a faculty member judges a student to be guilty of some form of academic 
dishonesty, the student may be given a failing grade for that piece of work or 
for the course, depending upon the severity of the misconduct.
</blockquote>

<p>
For the record, I have adopted the following standard policy on academic honesty.
<UL>
  <LI>
    You may discuss general issues with other students, or use other reference
    materials. Here, the general discussion precludes the detailed techniques
    or algorithms for solutions. In this case, any help you receive from someone
    or the references <B>must be acknowledged</B>. Failure to acknowledge the 
    source of a significant idea or approach will be considered cheating or
    plagiarism.
  <LI>
    Note that this does <B>not</B> mean that someone else can <I>do</I> your work.
    Unless otherwise explicitly specified, all programming projects and written
    assignments you submit must be done <B>independently</B>. You are not allowed to
    to look at another student's code/solutions or use the code that others 
    have submitted in the past.
  <LI>
    The corollary is that you may not do someone else's work for them either.
    A willing supplier of the material is as guilty of academic dishonesty as
    the receiver. Students are responsible for securing their work -- printed
    copies are not left in public places, and file/directory permissions are
    set to be unreadable.
</UL>

<H3>
Policy on W and I Grades
</H3>
<P>
RIT policy allows you to withdraw from a course with a grade of <B>W</B>
on or before the Friday of the sixth week in the quarter. After this date,
your instructor cannot give you a <B>W</B>, but must assign you a grade based
on your work.
<P>
This course has been designed so that you can complete all the work in one
quarter. Thus incomplete grades will be given only in the most exceptional
circumstances, and then only by <I>prior</I> arrangement with the
instructor who has the final say in this matter.

<H3>
Notes
</H3>
<p>
Any part of this page is subject to change any time in the quarter. In that case,
you will be informed in advance. Be alert to the announcements.
